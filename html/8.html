<h2>COMPUTER</h2>
<h3>GO TO TOP</h3>
<DIV ID="COMPUTER" >
	a computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arihematic or logical operations . Sinnce a sequence of operations can be readily changed ,the computer solve nore than one kind of problem.
</div>
<div id="cpu">
		<h3>CPU</h3>CPU is Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU (pronounced sea-pea-you) is the Central Processing Unit of the computer
<div id="alu">
		<h3>ALU</h3>ALU An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex 
</div>



<h2>PROGRAMMING LANGUAHES</h2>
<DIV ID="PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES">
	a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES is a High-level programming languages, while simple compared to human languages, are more complex than the languages the computer actually understands, called machine languages. Each different type of CPUhas its own unique machine language.
</div>
<div id="C">
		<h3>C</h3>C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System (OS) in the early 1970s.
</div>
<div id="CPP">
		<h3>CPP</h3>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style."
</div>



<h2>DBMS</h2>
<DIV ID=" DBMS">
	A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.
</div>
<div id="RDBMS">
		<h3>RDBMS</h3>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.
</div>
<div id="OODBMS">
		<h3>OODBMS</h3>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.
